As a means to help with testing and verifying, this page serves to list a handful of games that use the various services provided by the Switch OS. When adding to the list make sure to alphabetize the entry being added. Also please add where the service is used, so it's easier know where to go once the game is booted. For example, if `SomeRandomFunction` is used in a certain menu, indicate what menu in particular it is.
