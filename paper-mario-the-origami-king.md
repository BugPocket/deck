The following issues are encountered that the developers of yuzu are aware of:

* (Major) Some parts of the game will render the scene dark(ie, The castle). Temporary workaround is to use Vulkan instead of OpenGL(EA has this issue already fixed and should come to mainline soon.)
* (Minor) A vertex explosion occurs in the trees of the intro when OpenGL with assembly shaders is used.

Rendering:
* Largely accurate
